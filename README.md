# lxdcsu-Eyes-to-face-synthesis-dataset-processing
Eyes-to-face synthesis is a very interesting and meaningful research work, which can be applied in the fields of face reconstruction, archaeology and computer-aided design. At present, there is no public eyes-to-face dataset. To solve this problem, our team designed a scheme to obtain the dataset from the open face datasets CelebA [10] and LFW [11].
