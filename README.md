# lxdcsu-Eyes-to-face-synthesis-dataset-processing
## Introduction
<br>
This code is the eyes-to-face synthesis dataset processing. Eyes-to-face synthesis is a very interesting and meaningful research work, which can be applied in the fields of face reconstruction, archaeology and computer-aided design. At present, there is no public eyes-to-face dataset. To solve this problem, our team designed a scheme to obtain the dataset from the open face datasets CelebA [10] and LFW [11].

## Sample of eyes-to-face dataset
This dataset is obtained after processing on the public face datasets. Further works are discussed in the following papers:<br> 1) EyesGAN: Synthesize human face from human eyes, <br> 2) From eyes to face synthesis: a new approach for human-centered smart surveillance.
