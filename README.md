# lxdcsu-Eyes-to-face-synthesis-dataset-processing
## Introduction
Eyes-to-face synthesis is a very interesting and meaningful research work, which can be applied in the fields of face reconstruction, archaeology and computer-aided design. At present, there is no public eyes-to-face dataset. To solve this problem, our team designed a scheme to obtain the dataset from the open face datasets CelebA [10] and LFW [11].
## Sample of eyes-to-face dataset
This dataset is obtained after processing on the public face datasets. Further work is discussed in detail in the following papers, 1) EyesGAN: Synthesize human face from human eyes, 2)
